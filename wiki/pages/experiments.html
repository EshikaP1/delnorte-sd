  <p>
    It has been determined that several lab tests will be conducted to observe and understand Cutibacterium and biofilm. The importance of these tests is to give proof and make sure that our research, data, and results are viable and can be replicated. Other lab tests are completed to obtain statistics and analytics about our experiment in whole so the data can be analyzed and processed to reach a stable conclusion.

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>PCR testing done on the plasmid to ensure its viability</li>
      <li>qpcr is a type of PCR which monitors the real-time amplifications of the DNA-molecule. </li>
      <li>gel electrophoresis is also conducted to test reliance.</li>
      <li>mini-prep plasmid purification done to isolate plasmid DNA in order for it to be sequenced and have PCR done.</li>
      <li>NanoDrop spectrophotometer used to measure the concentration (especially useful when trying the grow biofilm as there must be a certain concentration of bacteria to grow.)</li>
      <li>Enzyme assays, specifically Stop-time assays, are conducted to measure the activity of PFK1 in the E.coli. </li>
    </ul>
