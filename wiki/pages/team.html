        <div class="cardBack"><span>Hi, my name is Ananya Asudani and I am a co-president of this team! This is my first
            year competing. I enjoy doing research as well as reading up on new treatments and therapeutics that can
            potentially benefit a plethora of diseases and disorders in the future. It is my goal and aspiration to
            create
            equity and enable students to have opportunities to do research! In my free time I love painting, teaching,
            and listening to music!
