    <h2>Some advice</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be concise, accurate, and unambiguous in your achievements. Your Project Description should include more information than your project abstract.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h2>References</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.</p>

      <h1 class="section-title">Overview:</h1>
      <p>
        Biofilm is made when the bacterial cells adhere to a surface and produce a matrix of Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS). They become embedded in this matrix and it protects them from being destroyed. Therefore, before destroying any bacteria, the extracellular matrix around is necessary to be destroyed first. This biofilm is mainly made up of mono and polysaccharides. In Cutibacterium Acne, major components that make up the biofilm include proteins, lipids, and sugars, which all help to maintain the structural integrity of the biofilm. By using enzyme inhibition/substrate analog inhibition/gene editing in targeting the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyltransferase (GlmU),  can be prevented and disrupt biofilm structure, which then can allow reach into destroying the bacteria that causes the acne that lays inside it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem Statement:
        Cutibacterium acnes is one of the most common forms of acne, affecting over 45 million individuals in the United States alone, particularly adolescents. Cutibacterium can implicate conditions such as endocarditis, endophthalmitis, septic arthritis, and more. Furthermore, acne vulgaris causes an immense amount of psychological distress, such as reduced mental health and self-esteem. This can further lead to the suffering of adolescents all across the United States. The Cutibacterium creates a protective biofilm on the skin, hindering the effectiveness of topical treatments for acne vulgaris. Destroying this biofilm is necessary for enhancing the value of acne treatments, further leading to improved skin appearance and overall acne management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Synthetic Biology Application:
        This project utilizes synthetic biology to eradicate biofilms by targeting their polysaccharide matrix. Our project does this by targeting the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyltransferase (GlmU) enzyme found in Cutibacterium Acne. This can disrupt the biofilm structure which allows the destruction of the bacteria that causes acne. By using enzyme inhibitors, substrate analogs like UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-N-acetylglucosamine or CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out genes encoding these enzymes, we aim to disrupt biofilm formation. This approach will expose the bacteria, allowing for their destruction and offering a potential treatment strategy for conditions like acne.

      <h1 class="section-title">WHAT:</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6598116/">Informational article</a>, here we find out that the biofilm that we are trying to destroy is mainly made up of polysaccharides. Basically how biofilm is made is when the bacterial cells adhere to a surface and produce a matrix of Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS). They become embedded in this matrix and it protects them from being destroyed. Therefore, destroying the matrix is necessary to thereby destroy the bacteria inside.

      <p>
        Bifunctional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase / glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase:
        C00075 + C04501 <=> C00013 + C00043 This is the reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subsection-title">Given Comment:</h1>
      <p>
        Part of the pathway for acetamido sugar biosynthesis in bacteria and archaea. The enzyme from several bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Haemophilus influenzae) has been shown to be bifunctional and also to possess the activity of EC 2.3.1.157, glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase. The enzyme from plants and animals is also active toward N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine 1-phosphate (cf. EC 2.7.7.83, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine diphosphorylase), while the bacterial enzyme shows low activity toward that substrate.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we wish to use CRISPR 9…the genes encoding for this protein are all listed on the Kegg pathway.

        Given comment: The bacterial enzyme can also use ITP and dGTP as donors.

        How and why we chose/inspiration behind it:
        Targeting Cutibacterium Acne was a significant topic for us because there are many people all around us who struggle with acne. By focusing on targeting acne, we can make a real impact and transform lives. Acne isn't just a skin condition; it’s a daily struggle that impacts mental health, self-confidence, and social interactions. More than that, it can be a serious health problem for severe cases, causing scarring and secondary infection. Addressing acne comprehensively is very prevalent in our world today and crucial for overall health and well-being. An enzyme based treatment can revolutionize skincare, improving the skin of many without harsh chemical treatments. We found that focusing on acne and cosmetics was something that we were passionate about and something that we believed could really make a difference in our world to so many people.
