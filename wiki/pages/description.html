I have an image stores as a .png file in my directory. I want to add it to one of my .HTML files. How to do I do that..what is the commad?

ChatGPT
To add an image stored as a .png file to your HTML file, you can use the <img> tag. Here's how you can do it:

Make sure your image file is in the same directory as your HTML file, or note the correct path to the image file if it is in a different directory.

Open your HTML file with a text editor.

Add the following line where you want the image to appear:

html
Copy code
<img src="path/to/your/image.png" alt="Description of the image">
Replace "path/to/your/image.png" with the actual path to your image file. If the image is in the same directory as your HTML file, you can just use the filename:

html
Copy code
<img src="image.png" alt="Description of the image">
Here is an example of a simple HTML file that includes an image:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>Here is an image:</p>
    <img src="image.png" alt="A description of the image">
</body>
</html>
Make sure to save your changes to the HTML file. When you open the HTML file in a web browser, the image should be displayed where you added the <img> tag.

what type of image is this : https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595433707802-6b2626ef1c91?q=80&w=2960&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D%22

The URL you provided links to an image hosted on Unsplash, which is typically a high-quality JPEG image. The URL includes parameters for formatting and fitting the image, which are common features of Unsplash URLs to optimize images for web usage. Specifically:

q=80 specifies the image quality.
w=2960 specifies the image width in pixels.
auto=format applies automatic formatting.
fit=crop crops the image to fit the specified dimensions.
The ixlib and ixid parameters are used for internal tracking by Unsplash.
Given this information, the image is most likely in JPEG format, optimized for web display.

To include this image in your HTML file, you can use the same <img> tag, but with the URL as the src attribute:

html
Copy code
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595433707802-6b2626ef1c91?q=80&w=2960&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D%22" alt="Description of the image">

        Biofilm is made when the bacterial cells adhere to a surface and produce a matrix of Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS). They become embedded in this matrix and it protects them from being destroyed. Therefore, before destroying any bacteria, the extracellular matrix around is necessary to be destroyed first. This biofilm is mainly made up of mono and polysaccharides. In Cutibacterium Acne, major components that make up the biofilm include proteins, lipids, and sugars, which all help to maintain the structural integrity of the biofilm. By using enzyme inhibition/substrate analog inhibition/gene editing in targeting the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyltransferase (GlmU),  can be prevented and disrupt biofilm structure, which then can allow reach into destroying the bacteria that causes the acne that lays inside it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem Statement:
        Cutibacterium acnes is one of the most common forms of acne, affecting over 45 million individuals in the United States alone, particularly adolescents. Cutibacterium can implicate conditions such as endocarditis, endophthalmitis, septic arthritis, and more. Furthermore, acne vulgaris causes an immense amount of psychological distress, such as reduced mental health and self-esteem. This can further lead to the suffering of adolescents all across the United States. The Cutibacterium creates a protective biofilm on the skin, hindering the effectiveness of topical treatments for acne vulgaris. Destroying this biofilm is necessary for enhancing the value of acne treatments, further leading to improved skin appearance and overall acne management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Synthetic Biology Application:
        This project utilizes synthetic biology to eradicate biofilms by targeting their polysaccharide matrix. Our project does this by targeting the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyltransferase (GlmU) enzyme found in Cutibacterium Acne. This can disrupt the biofilm structure which allows the destruction of the bacteria that causes acne. By using enzyme inhibitors, substrate analogs like UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-N-acetylglucosamine or CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out genes encoding these enzymes, we aim to disrupt biofilm formation. This approach will expose the bacteria, allowing for their destruction and offering a potential treatment strategy for conditions like acne.

The enzyme from several bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Haemophilus influenzae) has been shown to be bifunctional and also to possess the activity of EC 2.3.1.157, glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase. The enzyme from plants and animals is also active toward N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine 1-phosphate (cf. EC 2.7.7.83, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine diphosphorylase), while the bacterial enzyme shows low activity toward that substrate.

    How and why we chose/inspiration behind it:
    Targeting Cutibacterium Acne was a significant topic for us because there are many people all around us who struggle with acne. By focusing on targeting acne, we can make a real impact and transform lives. Acne isn't just a skin condition; it’s a daily struggle that impacts mental health, self-confidence, and social interactions. More than that, it can be a serious health problem for severe cases, causing scarring and secondary infection. Addressing acne comprehensively is very prevalent in our world today and crucial for overall health and well-being. An enzyme based treatment can revolutionize skincare, improving the skin of many without harsh chemical treatments. We found that focusing on acne and cosmetics was something that we were passionate about and something that we believed could really make a difference in our world to so many people.

In this version, each section (e.g., "Overview", "WHAT", "HOW", etc.) is enclosed in a div with the class container, ensuring consistent styling and centering. The CSS rules ensure that the container is centered horizontally within the page and that all text within the container is centered as well.

If you need additional sections or specific styling adjustments, you can add more div elements with the container class and modify the CSS accordingly. This should give you a clean, centered layout for your content.

okay this is not working....It looks like a mess. There is a base CSS in a style.css page and this is the code in that page:

.left-aligned { align-items: center; }

        <p>
            Biofilm is made when the bacterial cells adhere to a surface and produce a matrix of Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS). They become embedded in this matrix and it protects them from being destroyed. Therefore, before destroying any bacteria, the extracellular matrix around is necessary to be destroyed first. This biofilm is mainly made up of mono and polysaccharides. In Cutibacterium Acne, major components that make up the biofilm include proteins, lipids, and sugars, which all help to maintain the structural integrity of the biofilm. By using enzyme inhibition/substrate analog inhibition/gene editing in targeting the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyltransferase (GlmU), can be prevented and disrupt biofilm structure, which then can allow reach into destroying the bacteria that causes the acne that lays inside it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Problem Statement:
            Cutibacterium acnes is one of the most common forms of acne, affecting over 45 million individuals in the United States alone, particularly adolescents. Cutibacterium can implicate conditions such as endocarditis, endophthalmitis, septic arthritis, and more. Furthermore, acne vulgaris causes an immense amount of psychological distress, such as reduced mental health and self-esteem. This can further lead to the suffering of adolescents all across the United States. The Cutibacterium creates a protective biofilm on the skin, hindering the effectiveness of topical treatments for acne vulgaris. Destroying this biofilm is necessary for enhancing the value of acne treatments, further leading to improved skin appearance and overall acne management.
        </p>
        <p>
            Synthetic Biology Application:
            This project utilizes synthetic biology to eradicate biofilms by targeting their polysaccharide matrix. Our project does this by targeting the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyltransferase (GlmU) enzyme found in Cutibacterium Acne. This can disrupt the biofilm structure which allows the destruction of the bacteria that causes acne. By using enzyme inhibitors, substrate analogs like UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-N-acetylglucosamine or CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out genes encoding these enzymes, we aim to disrupt biofilm formation. This approach will expose the bacteria, allowing for their destruction and offering a potential treatment strategy for conditions like acne.

The enzyme from several bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Haemophilus influenzae) has been shown to be bifunctional and also to possess the activity of EC 2.3.1.157, glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase. The enzyme from plants and animals is also active toward N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine 1-phosphate (cf. EC 2.7.7.83, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine diphosphorylase), while the bacterial enzyme shows low activity toward that substrate.

        How and why we chose/inspiration behind it:
        Targeting Cutibacterium Acne was a significant topic for us because there are many people all around us who struggle with acne. By focusing on targeting acne, we can make a real impact and transform lives. Acne isn't just a skin condition; it’s a daily struggle that impacts mental health, self-confidence, and social interactions. More than that, it can be a serious health problem for severe cases, causing scarring and secondary infection. Addressing acne comprehensively is very prevalent in our world today and crucial for overall health and well-being. An enzyme based treatment can revolutionize skincare, improving the skin of many without harsh chemical treatments. We found that focusing on acne and cosmetics was something that we were passionate about and something that we believed could really make a difference in our world to so many people.

                Biofilm is made when the bacterial cells adhere to a surface and produce a matrix of Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS). They become embedded in this matrix and it protects them from being destroyed. Therefore, before destroying any bacteria, the extracellular matrix around is necessary to be destroyed first. This biofilm is mainly made up of mono and polysaccharides. In Cutibacterium Acne, major components that make up the biofilm include proteins, lipids, and sugars, which all help to maintain the structural integrity of the biofilm. By using enzyme inhibition/substrate analog inhibition/gene editing in targeting the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyltransferase (GlmU), can be prevented and disrupt biofilm structure, which then can allow reach into destroying the bacteria that causes the acne that lays inside it.

                Problem Statement:
                Cutibacterium acnes is one of the most common forms of acne, affecting over 45 million individuals in the United States alone, particularly adolescents. Cutibacterium can implicate conditions such as endocarditis, endophthalmitis, septic arthritis, and more. Furthermore, acne vulgaris causes an immense amount of psychological distress, such as reduced mental health and self-esteem. This can further lead to the suffering of adolescents all across the United States. The Cutibacterium creates a protective biofilm on the skin, hindering the effectiveness of topical treatments for acne vulgaris. Destroying this biofilm is necessary for enhancing the value of acne treatments, further leading to improved skin appearance and overall acne management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Synthetic Biology Application:
                This project utilizes synthetic biology to eradicate biofilms by targeting their polysaccharide matrix. Our project does this by targeting the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyltransferase (GlmU) enzyme found in Cutibacterium Acne. This can disrupt the biofilm structure which allows the destruction of the bacteria that causes acne. By using enzyme inhibitors, substrate analogs like UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-N-acetylglucosamine or CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out genes encoding these enzymes, we aim to disrupt biofilm formation. This approach will expose the bacteria, allowing for their destruction and offering a potential treatment strategy for conditions like acne.

                Targeting Cutibacterium Acne was a significant topic for us because there are many people all around us who struggle with acne. By focusing on targeting acne, we can make a real impact and transform lives. Acne isn't just a skin condition; it’s a daily struggle that impacts mental health, self-confidence, and social interactions. More than that, it can be a serious health problem for severe cases, causing scarring and secondary infection. Addressing acne comprehensively is very prevalent in our world today and crucial for overall health and well-being. An enzyme based treatment can revolutionize skincare, improving the skin of many without harsh chemical treatments. We found that focusing on acne and cosmetics was something that we were passionate about and something that we believed could really make a difference in our world to so many people.

            <p>
                Biofilm is made when the bacterial cells adhere to a surface and produce a matrix of Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS). They become embedded in this matrix and it protects them from being destroyed. Therefore, before destroying any bacteria, the extracellular matrix around is necessary to be destroyed first. This biofilm is mainly made up of mono and polysaccharides. In Cutibacterium Acne, major components that make up the biofilm include proteins, lipids, and sugars, which all help to maintain the structural integrity of the biofilm. By using enzyme inhibition/substrate analog inhibition/gene editing in targeting the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyltransferase (GlmU), can be prevented and disrupt biofilm structure, which then can allow reach into destroying the bacteria that causes the acne that lays inside it.

                Problem Statement:
                Cutibacterium acnes is one of the most common forms of acne, affecting over 45 million individuals in the United States alone, particularly adolescents. Cutibacterium can implicate conditions such as endocarditis, endophthalmitis, septic arthritis, and more. Furthermore, acne vulgaris causes an immense amount of psychological distress, such as reduced mental health and self-esteem. This can further lead to the suffering of adolescents all across the United States. The Cutibacterium creates a protective biofilm on the skin, hindering the effectiveness of topical treatments for acne vulgaris. Destroying this biofilm is necessary for enhancing the value of acne treatments, further leading to improved skin appearance and overall acne management.

                Synthetic Biology Application:
                This project utilizes synthetic biology to eradicate biofilms by targeting their polysaccharide matrix. Our project does this by targeting the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyltransferase (GlmU) enzyme found in Cutibacterium Acne. This can disrupt the biofilm structure which allows the destruction of the bacteria that causes acne. By using enzyme inhibitors, substrate analogs like UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-N-acetylglucosamine or CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out genes encoding these enzymes, we aim to disrupt biofilm formation. This approach will expose the bacteria, allowing for their destruction and offering a potential treatment strategy for conditions like acne.

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6598116/">Informational article</a>, here we find out that the biofilm that we are trying to destroy is mainly made up of polysaccharides. Basically how biofilm is made is when the bacterial cells adhere to a surface and produce a matrix of Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS). They become embedded in this matrix and it protects them from being destroyed. Therefore, destroying the matrix is necessary to thereby destroy the bacteria inside.

                Part of the pathway for acetamido sugar biosynthesis in bacteria and archaea. The enzyme from several bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Haemophilus influenzae) has been shown to be bifunctional and also to possess the activity of EC 2.3.1.157, glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase. The enzyme from plants and animals is also active toward N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine 1-phosphate (cf. EC 2.7.7.83, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine diphosphorylase), while the bacterial enzyme shows low activity toward that substrate.

                If we wish to use CRISPR 9…the genes encoding for this protein are all listed on the Kegg pathway.

                How and why we chose/inspiration behind it:
                Targeting Cutibacterium Acne was a significant topic for us because there are many people all around us who struggle with acne. By focusing on targeting acne, we can make a real impact and transform lives. Acne isn't just a skin condition; it’s a daily struggle that impacts mental health, self-confidence, and social interactions. More than that, it can be a serious health problem for severe cases, causing scarring and secondary infection. Addressing acne comprehensively is very prevalent in our world today and crucial for overall health and well-being. An enzyme-based treatment can revolutionize skincare, improving the skin of many without harsh chemical treatments. We found that focusing on acne and cosmetics was something that we were passionate about and something that we believed could really make a difference in our world to so many people.
