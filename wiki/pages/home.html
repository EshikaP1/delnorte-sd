  <p>
    Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) is a prevalent cause of skin infections and is the major causative agent in common
    acne
    vulgaris[1,2]. Cutibacterium acnes is one of the most common forms of acne, affecting over 45 million individuals in
    the United States alone, 9.4% of the world's population, particularly adolescents. It is estimated that as many as
    80%
    of adolescents develop acne, and 20% of all visits to the dermatologists are to seek care for acne. In addition to
    acneiform role, C. acnes is also implicated in other infections. As many as 10-40% of early postoperative infections
    have C. acnes as a causative agent. C. acnes is also found as a source in neurosurgical infections of ventricular
    shunts, the rate ranges from 1.5-38%. Addressing C. acnes infections is further complicated by a significant degree
    of
    antimicrobial resistance with some estimates that as many as 50.5% of patients with C. acnes were resistant to one
    or
    more antibiotics. Other infections caused by C. acnes include bone and joint infections, endocarditis and
    endophthalmitis [3-6]. Furthermore, acne vulgaris contributes to psychological distress, such as reduced mental
    health
    and self-esteem. This can further lead to the suffering of adolescents all across the United States. C. acnes, like
    several other bacteria, creates a protective biofilm on the skin, hindering the effectiveness of topical treatments
    for acne vulgaris. This makes infections more difficult to treat and prevents topical agents from being widely
    effective on C. acnes-induced acne. Biofilm is composed of microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances
    (EPS). EPS, which is composed of 62.6% polysaccharides is quite hardy and affords protection of the bacteria. By
    manipulating the innate carbohydrate degradation of C. acnes, the degradation of the extracellular matrix through
    the
    decomposition of carbohydrates is promoted.

  <span class="pTitle">OUR GOAL!</span>
  <img src="static/image/skininfo.png">
  <p>This study aims to genetically manipulate C. acnes biofilm by breaking down carbohydrates. This will be done by
    using a plasmid to produce the enzyme Phosphofructokinase, a catalyst of glycolysis. Since the biofilm is made up of
    over 50% carbohydrates, increasing the glycolytic activity of C. acnes by inserting a catalyst will allow for
    degradation of the biofilm. In the future, we aim to utilize a hydrogel to be our enzymatic transporter to
    administer this catalyst to C. acnes. </p>
